# FreeCodeCamp Data Engineering Projects

Welcome to my repository for **FreeCodeCamp's Data Engineering** curriculum projects. This space is dedicated to showcasing my solutions, progress, and the technical journey as I master data processing and analysis with Python.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository serves as a centralized hub for all my completed projects from the FreeCodeCamp certification. I will be continuously updating this collection as I advance through the curriculum, adding new solutions and refining existing ones.

### 🛠️ Development Environment & Tech Stack

These projects are built and tested using a modern, robust development workflow:

*   **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu via **WSL2** on Windows) - ensuring a powerful, production-grade logic environment.
*   **Language**: Python 3.14
*   **AI Pair Programming**: Developed in collaboration with **Antigravity** (Google DeepMind), leveraging advanced agentic coding capabilities for planning, logic verification, and code efficiency.
*   **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 📂 Projects

### 1. Arithmetic Formatter
*   **Description**: A console-based arithmetic arranger that formats addition and subtraction problems vertically.
*   **Key Features**: Error handling, dynamic spacing, and optional solution display.
*   **Status**: ✅ Completed

*(More projects to be added soon...)*

## 📈 Future Contributions

I am committed to expanding this repository with future projects such as:
*   Time Calculator
*   Budget App
*   Polygon Area Calculator
*   Probability Calculator
